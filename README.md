## Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

👋 I'm **[Alejandro Ruiz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arm-developer/)**, a Software Engineer with the skills to turn your ideas into reality, just like a genie out of a lamp! I excel at transforming your thoughts into code and am always on the lookout for the best way to work wonders in the digital realm.

💻 I specialize in JavaScript and I've experience with popular frameworks and libraries like Vue, React, Angular, and Astro. Additionally, I've used Node.js, Electron, among others. I'm passionate about creating applications and enjoy collaborating with people who can help me improve continuously.

⚙️ When I'm not immersed in code, I'm probably exploring new technologies, learning, and staying up-to-date with industry trends. I'm also passionate about playing soccer, although I'd like to boast that I'm like CR7, I'm not a professional at all.

Let's work together to develop extraordinary web experiences! 🚀
